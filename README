This is a proof of concept for using the Nexus 5 Camera HD audio output.

The code is a patch to the standard camera app from CyanogenMod that interfaces with the internal Camera HD audio output APIs.
This was successfully tested on the American LTE version of the Google Nexus 5.

This PoC is pretty rough around the edges, so feedback is highly appreciated.
